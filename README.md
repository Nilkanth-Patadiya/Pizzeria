These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### **Prerequisites** :

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:

* Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager. If you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.
* MongoDB - [Download & Install MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads), and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).
* Angular - Make sure you've installed Node.js and npm first, then install Angular globally using npm:

    ```
    npm install -g @angular/cli
    ```

### **Inserting Data In MongoDB Database** :

Using MongoDB Compass GUI Tool do the following:

- Create a database named "pizzeria"
- Create a collection with name "pizza" & insert the data into this collection from Data Folder -> **pizza.json** file.
- Create a collection with name "toppingsandingredients" & insert the data into this collection from Data Folder -> **toppingsandingredients.json** file. 

### **Starting Back-End Node Server** :

1) Download or clone the code from this repository.

   If you download as a zip file, be sure to unzip it.

2) Navigate to the pizserver folder.

   There should be a package.json file in this folder.

3) In a command window (or the Command prompt in VS Code), type below command.

    ```
    npm install
    ```

   This creates a **node_modules** folder and installs all packages from the package.json file into that folder. You may see a few warnings during this process, but you should not see any errors.
   
4) In the same command window (or the Command property in VS Code), type 

    ```
    npm start
    ```

   The application should then compile successfully and you should see  message like **"Connected to mongodb via mongoose"** in same window.

5) Go to Browser like Chrome/Edge and type this URL **http://localhost:3000/pizzas** & **http://localhost:3000//toppings** , you should get the response json from DB.

### **Starting Angular Dev Server** :

1) Download or clone the code from this repository.

   If you download as a zip file, be sure to unzip it.

2) Navigate to the pizclient folder.

   There should be a package.json file in this folder.

3) In a command window (or the Command prompt in VS Code), type below command.

    ```
    npm install
    ```

   This creates a **node_modules** folder and installs all packages from the package.json file into that folder. You may see a few warnings during this process, but you should not see any errors.
   
4) In the same command window (or the Command property in VS Code), type 

    ```
    ng serve
    ```

   The application should then compile successfully and you should see  message like **"Angular Live Development Server is listening on localhost:4200, open your browser on http://localhost:4200/"**.

5) Congratulations now you have a working pizza app, Bravo!!
